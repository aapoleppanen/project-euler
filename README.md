My Project-euler solutions

These are my project-euler solutions. They can also be found on my website www.leppanenpi.tk/project-euler. 

Right now I have the solutions all in one .js file, which I plan on changing in the future. This whole repository also contains a working website which displays a website with the solutions along with calculating them all and posting the time it took for each function.
